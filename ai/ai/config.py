NontentAI is used to predict the domain of a given tweet. It classifies tweets into 12 categories: `WAR`, `GAMING`, `TECH`, `SCIENCE`, `MUSIC`, `POLICY`, `CINEMA`, `SPORT`, `MEDICAL`, `LITERATURE`, `FOOD`, and `MARKETING`.

## API Details

This API is built using FastAPI, and the model used for classification is a trained machine learning model that was pickled and saved. The model uses a vectorizer to transform the tweets into feature vectors, and then predicts the domain based on those feature vectors.

## Endpoints

### 1. `/predict`

### 2. `/predicts`
